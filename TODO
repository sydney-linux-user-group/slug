Polleyj:
- Put iCal icons in each event - per event/all events
- RSS icon for all events - somewhere prominent + metadata
- Move future/current/next events code into model
- Send announcement email to announce list
  - For now, just stick a button on /events for admins
  - Later, we want automation.
- Add "Published" status to Events
  - future/current/next events should only return published events by default
  - optionally return all events - only for admins
  - clicking button to send "announce" email changes state to "published"

BUGS:
 - event/<<id>>/edit page should *not* display list of future dates.
 - but should have "create another event" button.

Export attendees list for organisers (polleyj)
